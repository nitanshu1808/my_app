Scenario:
You are building an order processing system for an e-commerce website. You have an array of orders where each order is represented as a hash.

Each order contains:

id: Order ID
customer: Customer name
items: An array of items purchased (each item is a hash containing name, price, and quantity).
status: Order status ("pending", "shipped", or "delivered")
Task:
Calculate the total revenue (sum of price * quantity for all orders).
Group orders by status (return a hash where keys are statuses and values are arrays of orders).
Find the top customer who spent the most money.
List unique products sold, along with their total quantity.



Sample Input

orders = [
  { id: 1, customer: "Alice", items: [{ name: "Laptop", price: 1000, quantity: 1 }, { name: "Mouse", price: 50, quantity: 2 }], status: "shipped" },
  { id: 2, customer: "Bob", items: [{ name: "Laptop", price: 1000, quantity: 2 }], status: "pending" },
  { id: 3, customer: "Alice", items: [{ name: "Keyboard", price: 100, quantity: 1 }], status: "delivered" },
  { id: 4, customer: "Charlie", items: [{ name: "Monitor", price: 300, quantity: 1 }], status: "shipped" },
]


Expected Output

total_revenue => 3450
grouped_orders => { "shipped" => [order_1, order_4], "pending" => [order_2], "delivered" => [order_3] }
top_customer => "Bob" # (spent 2000)
unique_products => { "Laptop" => 3, "Mouse" => 2, "Keyboard" => 1, "Monitor" => 1 }
